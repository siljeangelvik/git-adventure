# The Repository of Theseus

## Chapter One

Once upon a time there was a web developer called Theseus, who lived in a wooden boat.  
One day Theseus decided to create a new app to help with carpentry.  
After planning, Theseus started by creating a new folder and repository. 

Fearing that a life close to water might damage his laptop,   
Theseus made sure to use a remote repository.  
Each time Theseus made an important change,   
Theseus would commit this change to his local branch with a clear message.   
Every evening, Theseus would push his local branch to make sure it was safely backed up.  

Bit by bit, Theseus' application took shape.   
Although it was not perfect, it was very useful.

One day Theseus found himself stuck on a bug in a new feature.   
Despite reading hundreds of pages of documentation and discussions,   
the solution eluded Theseus.

Theseus decided to make a post on a forum offering his application to anyone who wanted to use it for free.   
He described its purpose, features and his plan for the future and spent that evening answering questions from the community.

## Chapter Two

The next morning, Theseus saw that he had an email notification.   
Someone had forked his repository, adding their own solution.   
They requested a Pull Review to merge their code into his.  

Looking at the diff diagram, he could see the elegant solution to his bug.   
He checked out the new branch and tested on his computer.   
Happy that it worked perfectly, he accepted the pull request.  

The morning after that, he had more emails from more contributors.   
Although some were not good enough to be added, the others were useful and written well.   
Soon, Theseus spent little time writing new code for his project, instead managing discussions,   
reviewing pull requests and creating release tags.  

This continued for many months and one day Theseus thought to himself:  
  
"I wonder how many of the files in this project still contain my code"  

He analysed the files in the repository and found that not a single line of his original code was still in use.   
Over time, all of it had been replaced by cleaner, faster and smarter code from his contributors.

Pondering whether the application could truly be called his own,   
he decided to commit to an open source license so that everyone could enjoy the code for free, forever.

The End.
